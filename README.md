### Kafka Udemy Course

This is my code base for Stephane Maarek's 'Learn Apache Kafka for Beginners v2' course on Udemy.
The TwitterHbcProducer.java and TwitterElasticConsume.java files are my original work on the given 
exercise to create a producer that sends messages to Kafka from Twitter, and then 
consumes those messages with an Elasticsearch Consumer.
After I completed the exercise, I reviewed the  following lectures 
and updated the code to be more secure (prevent data loss) and to follow the best practices for Kafka
and Elasticsearch provided by Stephane.
